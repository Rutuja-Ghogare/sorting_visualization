# Alogorithm Sorting Visualization
# Introduction:
This web application aims to provide a visual representation of various sorting algorithms.
By observing the sorting process in action, users can gain insights into the time and space complexities of each algorithm.

# Implemented Algorithms:
The following sorting algorithms have been implemented in the application:

- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort

# Features:
Colored Representation:
The visualization uses different colors to represent the state of the elements being sorted:

- Grey: Elements in their default positions.
- Yellow: Elements currently being compared.
- Red: Elements identified as being incorrectly positioned and will be moved.
- Green: Elements that have reached their correct positions after sorting.

# Visualization Controls:
The application provides the following controls to customize the visualization:

- Speed of Visualization: Users can choose from five speed levels to control the animation speed of the sorting process.
- Data Size: Users can adjust the size of the data set to visualize different numbers of elements being sorted.
- Generation of New Data: Users can generate new random data sets to observe the sorting algorithms on different data inputs.

# Time and Space Complexity:
During the visualization, users can access information about the time and space complexity of the algorithm being visualized. This allows for a better understanding of the efficiency of each sorting algorithm.


# Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
